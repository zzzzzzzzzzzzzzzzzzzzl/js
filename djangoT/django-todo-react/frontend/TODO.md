collision-
check each object agaisnt every other object.
compare 2 objects and if the sum of both of the radius is less than the distance between 2 of them then this will count as a collision
collision will be quite costly to run so to optimize it we should dive the area into a grid and only check collision between object within the tile and with neighbouring tiles
rotation-
solved

tileArr out of range error- dont go outside bounds of env. --
